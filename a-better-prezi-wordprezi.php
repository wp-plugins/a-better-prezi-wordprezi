You won't realize how ugly a prezi presentation looks when embedded 
in your website until you actually invest hours, even days, in designing
the ultimate presentation, learn all the basics and more, get the file
to play in your site, and then… it hits you: Something is wrong
and no matter what parameters you use for your embed it NEVER looks
as nice as it does on prezi.com explore section.

This plugin helps WordPress finding your presentation no matter what page
you embedded it, when using the only prezi player in the market that gets
rid of the GIANT title box and the ugly low-res thumbnail, by auto-loading
and even auto-playing your presentation. Developed by Slidynamic.com
that player uploaded to your server, along with the standalone (off-line)
version of your prezi presentation, makes possible to make the time
you invested on making your presentation attractive worth it,
playing it as beautifully and even more functionally than in prezi's
own website. It even supports different delays for each slide!

The only bump that incredibly better prezi player solution finds is
the standalone player was designed to "look" for the required files 
in the SAME directory as the page it's on, searching for those files
in EVERY directory you are at only.
You'll notice that once your prezi looks pretty again, it fails because
of missing files if embedded in several pages (like in WordPress header)
and uploading those files (around 20MB) to every directory your pages
are in is not an option.
Just install this plugin and all your prezi presentation will run 
smoothly no matter how many pages you embedded it in,
by using advanced apache redirection rules in your server.
 
 (Only compatible with Linux hostings, for now. 
 You'll know if your wordpress is running on Linux
 if your articles urls look like name-of-article, 
 rather than index.php?p=308)
